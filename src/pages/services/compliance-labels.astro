const faqItems = [
  {
    question: "What are the 2025 Plain Language Labelling (PLL) changes for Canada?",
    answer: "Health Canada's new Plain Language Labelling regulations came into force June 21, 2025, requiring a standardized Product Facts Table (PFT) with specific formatting: sans-serif fonts, high-contrast design, and clear bilingual presentation. All Natural Health Products must comply by June 22, 2028. The PFT must include medicinal ingredients, uses, warnings, directions, non-medicinal ingredients, and contact information in an easy-to-read format."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between Supplement Facts, Nutrition Facts, and Product Facts?",
    answer: "These are distinct labeling formats for different product types: 'Supplement Facts' panels are required by the FDA for dietary supplements in the US. 'Nutrition Facts' labels are for conventional foods. In Canada, 'Product Facts Tables (PFT)' are used for Natural Health Products following 2025 PLL regulations, while 'Nutrition Facts' tables are for foods. Each has specific formatting rules and required information unique to their regulatory framework."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between US and Canadian labeling requirements?",
    answer: "US labels require FDA-compliant Supplement Facts panels and follow DSHEA regulations for dietary supplements. Canadian labels need bilingual Product Facts Tables (PFT) following 2025 Plain Language Labelling regulations, must comply with Natural Health Products Regulations, and require NPN numbers. Canada also requires full bilingual presentation in both English and French. We ensure your labels meet both jurisdictions' specific requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need separate labels for the US and Canadian markets?",
    answer: "Not always. We can often design unified labels that meet both FDA and Health Canada requirements, saving you printing costs and inventory complexity. However, some products may need market-specific labels depending on approved claims and regulatory differences."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the label review and approval process take?",
    answer: "Our standard timeline is 1-2 weeks from project start to final approved labels. This includes nutrition analysis, content development, design, and regulatory review. Rush services are available for faster turnaround when needed."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with nutrition analysis for the label facts?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide comprehensive nutrition analysis services including laboratory testing when required. We ensure all nutrition facts are accurate and compliant with regulatory requirements for both serving size determination and nutrient content claims."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my product claims are rejected by regulators?",
    answer: "We conduct thorough pre-approval claim review to minimize rejections. If issues arise, we work with you to modify claims while maintaining marketing effectiveness. Our regulatory expertise helps ensure claims are both compliant and commercially viable."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide print-ready files for manufacturing?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We deliver high-resolution, print-ready files in multiple formats suitable for various printing methods. Files include proper bleeds, color specifications, and technical notes for your manufacturer to ensure perfect reproduction."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you translate existing labels for the Canadian market?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide professional regulatory translation services from English to French for Canadian market compliance. Our certified translators understand nuances of supplement terminology and ensure cultural appropriateness for Quebec markets."
  },
  {
    question: "How is pricing determined for label design and compliance review?",
    answer: "Pricing varies based on multiple factors including product complexity, number of ingredients, target markets (US, Canada, or both), formulation type, required testing, claim substantiation needs, and timeline requirements. Each project is unique, and we provide detailed custom quotes based on your specific requirements. Contact us for a personalized quote tailored to your product and business needs."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in your label compliance review?",
    answer: "Our review covers Supplement Facts/Product Facts Table accuracy, ingredient declaration compliance, claim substantiation, warning statement requirements, font size regulations (minimum 8-point for standard packages, 6-point for column headings), mandatory information placement, bilingual requirements for Canada, and overall regulatory compliance for your target markets including 2025 PLL standards."
