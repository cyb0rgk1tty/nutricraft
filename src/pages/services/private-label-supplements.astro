// FAQ Items
const faqItems = [
  {
    question: "What's the difference between private label and white label supplements?",
    answer: "Private label supplements are custom formulas created exclusively for your brand, giving you complete control over ingredients and formulation. White label supplements use our pre-made, market-tested formulas that you can quickly brand as your own. Private label takes 12-16 weeks and costs more, while white label can launch in 4-6 weeks at a lower cost. Both options start at just 1000 units minimum order."
  },
  {
    question: "What's your minimum order quantity (MOQ)?",
    answer: "Our minimum order quantity is just 1000 units for most products - 3-5x lower than industry standard. This low MOQ means you can start with an investment as low as $8,000 instead of the typical $30,000+ required elsewhere. For gummies, the MOQ is 2500 units, and powders start at 500 units. This allows you to test the market and scale gradually without huge upfront costs."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to launch my supplement brand?",
    answer: "White label products can be ready in 4-6 weeks since the formulas are already developed and tested. Private label custom formulations typically take 12-16 weeks from concept to delivery, including R&D, stability testing, and production. We can expedite timelines for rush orders with our express manufacturing service."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your supplements FDA compliant?",
    answer: "Yes, all our supplements are manufactured in an FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility that follows strict quality standards. We handle all regulatory compliance including proper labeling, structure-function claims review, and documentation. Our quality team ensures every batch meets or exceeds FDA requirements for dietary supplements."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of supplements can you manufacture?",
    answer: "We manufacture all major supplement formats including capsules (veggie and gelatin), tablets (standard and chewable), softgels, gummies, powders (bulk and stick packs), and liquids. We have 200+ stock formulas across categories like sports nutrition, weight management, immune support, beauty, and general wellness. Custom formulations are available for any supplement type."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does private label manufacturing cost?",
    answer: "White label supplements typically cost $8-12 per unit at our 1000 unit minimum, totaling $8,000-12,000 to start. Private label custom formulas cost $12-18 per unit at minimum quantity, plus $5,000-10,000 for initial R&D and testing. Prices decrease significantly with higher volumes - up to 35% savings at 10,000+ units. All quotes include manufacturing, basic packaging, and quality testing."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer fulfillment and dropshipping services?",
    answer: "Yes, we offer complete fulfillment services including inventory storage, pick-and-pack, and direct-to-consumer shipping. Our dropshipping program allows you to sell without holding inventory - we ship directly to your customers with your branding. This is perfect for e-commerce businesses wanting to test products or scale without warehouse costs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get samples before placing a full order?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide samples of our stock formulas so you can evaluate quality before committing. For white label products, sample sets are available for $50-100. For private label custom formulations, we'll create small test batches during R&D for your approval. This ensures you're 100% satisfied with the product before full production."
  },
  {
    question: "What certifications do you have?",
    answer: "Our facility is FDA-registered, GMP-certified (Good Manufacturing Practices), NSF-certified for sport supplements, and ISO 9001:2015 certified. We also maintain certifications for organic, non-GMO, vegan, and kosher products. Third-party testing is conducted on all batches with Certificates of Analysis provided."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with label design and branding?",
    answer: "Yes, we offer complete label design and branding services. Our design team can create professional labels that meet all FDA requirements while showcasing your brand. We also provide marketing support including product photography, sell sheets, and Amazon listings. Label design typically costs $500-1500 depending on complexity."
