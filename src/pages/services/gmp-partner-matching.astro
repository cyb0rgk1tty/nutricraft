const faqData = [
  {
    question: "How is this different from your standard manufacturing services?",
    answer: "Nutricraft's core business works with 15+ GMP-certified partner manufacturers who handle 95% of client needs. This extended network service is specifically for specialized requirements our core partners can't fulfillâ€”like unique formats, niche certifications, or ultra-high volumes."
  },
  {
    question: "When do I need this service vs. your regular manufacturing?",
    answer: "Use our core manufacturing services for standard supplements (capsules, tablets, powders, gummies, softgels) with typical MOQs. This service is for edge cases: liposomal formulations, Kosher certification, EU-based manufacturing, proprietary technologies, or volumes exceeding our partners' capacity."
  },
  {
    question: "What does this service actually cost?",
    answer: "Initial consultation is free to determine if extended network search is needed. If so, the search and vetting service is $2,500 flat fee. Upon successful partnership and first production run, there's a success fee of 3-5% of the first order value. All ongoing support for 6 months is included."
  },
  {
    question: "Are the fees the same for every project?",
    answer: "No, fees vary depending on the complexity of your requirements, search scope, and manufacturer location. Highly specialized needs (like proprietary technologies or rare certifications) require more extensive vetting and may have different fee structures. We provide a customized quote during your free consultation based on your specific situation."
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I use Nutricraft instead of finding manufacturers myself?",
    answer: "We conduct rigorous vetting (facility audits, certification checks, reference verification) that takes weeks and industry expertise. We also negotiate better terms using our relationships and provide ongoing support. Most importantly, we protect you from unqualified manufacturers that could jeopardize your brand."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you stay involved after the match?",
    answer: "Yes! We provide 6 months of relationship management support including quality issue resolution, communication facilitation, and production problem-solving. Even after that period, we remain available for consultation as needed."
  },
  {
    question: "What if you can't find a suitable manufacturer?",
    answer: "During our initial free consultation, we honestly assess feasibility. If we can't find a qualified match after our extended search, we refund the $2,500 search fee. We only succeed when you succeed, which is why we're transparent about limitations upfront."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you vet manufacturers in your extended network?",
    answer: "Same standards as our core partners: third-party audit report review, current GMP certifications (FDA, NSF, USP, or equivalent), financial stability checks, production capacity verification, and reference checks with existing clients. We also verify insurance and quality systems."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with international manufacturing?",
    answer: "Yes, our extended network includes vetted manufacturers in the EU, Asia-Pacific, and other regions. We help navigate international logistics, regulatory differences (EFSA, TGA, etc.), and communication. However, we always recommend domestic manufacturing when possible for simpler compliance."
