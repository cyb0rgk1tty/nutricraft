const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Do you offer standalone lab testing services?",
    answer: "No. Quality testing is included as an integral part of all our manufacturing services - we coordinate testing through ISO 17025 accredited third-party labs for every batch we produce. We do not test products manufactured by other companies. If you're looking for standalone testing, we recommend contacting labs like Eurofins (eurofins.com) or NSF (nsf.org) directly."
  },
  {
    question: "What testing is included with my manufacturing order?",
    answer: "Every manufacturing order includes comprehensive testing based on your product type and target market. At minimum, all orders include identity, potency, microbial, and heavy metal testing. We'll create a custom testing protocol based on your specific regulatory requirements - this is all included in your manufacturing quote."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does testing add to my manufacturing timeline?",
    answer: "Testing typically adds 7-10 business days to your production timeline for lab analysis. This is built into our standard manufacturing timelines, so there's no surprise delay. Stability testing for new formulations requires longer timelines (3-6 months for accelerated studies), which we'll discuss during your project planning."
  },
  {
    question: "Which laboratories do you work with?",
    answer: "We partner with ISO 17025 accredited laboratories including Eurofins, Micro Quality Labs, and SORA Labs. All our partner labs are FDA-registered and follow USP testing methodologies. The testing coordination is handled by us as part of your manufacturing project."
  },
  {
    question: "Is stability testing included?",
    answer: "Basic stability testing is included with custom formulation projects. For accelerated (3-6 months) or real-time (24+ months) stability studies, we coordinate these as part of your formulation package. This includes ICH-compliant protocols, proper storage conditions, and interval testing to establish shelf life."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a Certificate of Analysis (COA)?",
    answer: "A COA is a document that confirms your product meets its specifications. It includes test results for identity, purity, strength, and composition. Every batch we manufacture comes with a complete COA - this is included with your order at no additional charge."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you test for allergens?",
    answer: "Yes, allergen testing is available for products that require it. We coordinate testing for the Big 9 allergens (milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans, sesame) plus any additional allergens relevant to your product. This is included when required for your formulation."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure testing accuracy?",
    answer: "All testing is performed by third-party ISO 17025 accredited laboratories using validated methods. We also implement skip-lot testing programs for established products and retain samples for future reference. Because we manage the entire manufacturing process, we can ensure proper sample collection and chain of custody."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my product fails testing?",
    answer: "If a batch fails testing, we work with you to understand the results and determine next steps. Options may include retesting to confirm results, reformulating, adjusting manufacturing processes, or in rare cases, disposing of the batch. Because we handle manufacturing and testing together, we can quickly identify root causes and implement corrections."
  },
  {
    question: "Do major retailers require specific testing?",
    answer: "Yes, and we ensure your products meet those requirements. Amazon requires third-party testing with documented COAs (included). Walmart typically requires NSF or similar certification (we can coordinate). Whole Foods has specific heavy metals and microbial requirements (included). Prop 65 compliance testing for California sales is also available. We build all required testing into your manufacturing project."
  },
  {
    question: "What is California Prop 65 and is testing included?",
    answer: "California Proposition 65 requires warnings for products containing certain levels of heavy metals. If you sell in California (including online), you must comply. We include Prop 65 compliance testing for manufacturing clients. Safe Harbor limits are: Lead 0.5 mcg/day, Arsenic 10 mcg/day, Cadmium 4.1 mcg/day, Mercury 0.3 mcg/day. We'll advise if your product needs Prop 65 warnings based on test results."
