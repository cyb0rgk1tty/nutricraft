const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What testing is required for my supplement?",
    answer: "Testing requirements depend on your product type, target market, and regulatory requirements. At minimum, most supplements require identity, potency, microbial, and heavy metal testing. We'll create a custom testing protocol based on your specific needs."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does testing typically take?",
    answer: "Standard testing packages take 7-10 business days for lab analysis, plus 2-3 days each way for shipping (14-21 days total turnaround). Expedited testing (5-7 days total) is available for an additional 50% fee. Stability testing requires longer timelines, typically 3-6 months for accelerated studies or 12-24 months for real-time shelf life studies."
  },
  {
    question: "Which laboratories do you work with?",
    answer: "We partner with ISO 17025 accredited laboratories including Eurofins, Micro Quality Labs, and SORA Labs. All our partner labs are FDA-registered and follow USP testing methodologies."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with stability testing?",
    answer: "Yes, we coordinate both accelerated (3-6 months) and real-time (24+ months) stability studies. This includes ICH-compliant protocols, proper storage conditions, and interval testing to establish shelf life."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a Certificate of Analysis (COA)?",
    answer: "A COA is a document that confirms your product meets its specifications. It includes test results for identity, purity, strength, and composition. COAs are required for regulatory compliance and customer confidence."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you test for allergens?",
    answer: "Yes, we coordinate allergen testing for the Big 9 allergens (milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans, sesame) plus any additional allergens relevant to your product."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure testing accuracy?",
    answer: "All testing is performed by third-party ISO 17025 accredited laboratories using validated methods. We also implement skip-lot testing programs and retain samples for future reference."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does supplement testing cost?",
    answer: "Testing costs vary by test type and package. Typical ranges: Identity testing ($50-150), Microbial panel ($150-300), Heavy metals ($200-400), Full potency panel ($300-800). Basic packages start around $800-1,200 for identity, potency, microbials, and heavy metals. Comprehensive packages including stability testing range from $3,000-5,000. Rush fees add approximately 50% to standard pricing. We provide detailed quotes based on your specific testing needs."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my product fails testing?",
    answer: "If your product fails testing, we help you understand the results and your options. Depending on the failure, you may need to: retest to confirm results, reformulate the product, adjust manufacturing processes, or dispose of the batch. We provide guidance on root cause analysis and connect you with experts who can help resolve formulation or manufacturing issues. Failed batches cannot be released for sale and must be addressed before distribution."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I test my products?",
    answer: "FDA regulations require testing of each production batch for identity, purity, strength, and composition. At minimum, you must test every batch of finished product. However, many brands implement skip-lot testing programs after establishing consistent manufacturing quality (typically after 10-20 consecutive passing batches), testing every 3rd or 5th lot instead. Raw material testing should be done for each new lot received. Annual stability testing is recommended to monitor shelf life."
  },
  {
    question: "Do major retailers require specific testing?",
    answer: "Yes, major retailers have specific testing requirements. Amazon requires third-party testing for supplements with documented COAs. Walmart typically requires NSF or similar third-party certification. Whole Foods requires testing for heavy metals, microbials, and often requests organic certification testing. Most retailers also require Prop 65 compliance testing if selling in California. We can help you understand and meet specific retailer requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "What is California Prop 65 and do I need to comply?",
    answer: "California Proposition 65 requires warnings for products containing certain levels of heavy metals and other chemicals. If you sell in California, you must comply. Safe Harbor limits are: Lead 0.5 mcg/day (reproductive), Arsenic 10 mcg/day, Cadmium 4.1 mcg/day, Mercury 0.3 mcg/day. Testing is required to determine if your daily dose exceeds these limits. Products exceeding limits must carry Prop 65 warnings. We coordinate Prop 65 compliance testing and help you understand your obligations."
