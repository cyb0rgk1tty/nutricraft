// FAQ Items - Comprehensive from both pages
const faqItems = [
  {
    question: "What's the difference between private label and white label supplements?",
    answer: "Private label supplements are custom formulas created exclusively for your brand, giving you complete control over ingredients and formulation. White label supplements use our pre-made, market-tested formulas that you can quickly brand as your own. Private label takes 12-16 weeks and costs more, while white label can launch in 4-6 weeks at a lower cost. Both options start at just 1000 units minimum order."
  },
  {
    question: "What's your minimum order quantity (MOQ)?",
    answer: "Our minimum order quantity is just 1000 units for all products - 3-5x lower than industry standard. This low MOQ means you can start with an investment as low as $8,000 instead of the typical $30,000+ required elsewhere. This allows you to test the market and scale gradually without huge upfront costs."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to launch my supplement brand?",
    answer: "White label products can be ready in 4-6 weeks since the formulas are already developed and tested. Private label custom formulations typically take 12-16 weeks from concept to delivery, including R&D, stability testing, and production. For the Canadian market, add 60-90 days if NPN approval is needed. We can expedite timelines for rush orders with our express manufacturing service."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need an NPN to sell supplements in Canada?",
    answer: "Yes, all supplements sold in Canada require a Natural Product Number (NPN) from Health Canada. Many of our white label formulas already have NPNs or are NPN-ready, significantly reducing your time to market. We handle the entire application process for formulas that need new NPNs. The approval process typically takes 60-90 days for Class I products."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the bilingual labeling requirements for Canada?",
    answer: "Health Canada requires all supplement labels to be in both English and French. This includes product name, directions for use, warnings, and all mandatory label information. We provide professional bilingual label design and translation services to ensure full compliance. The 'Product Facts' table must be prominently displayed in both languages."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I sell the same products in both Canada and the US?",
    answer: "Yes, but you'll need different labels for each market. US labels don't require French text and have different regulatory requirements. Canadian products need NPN numbers and bilingual labels, while US products follow FDA guidelines. We can produce separate runs for each market or help you create dual-market compliant labels where possible."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your supplements FDA and Health Canada compliant?",
    answer: "Yes, all our supplements are manufactured in FDA-registered, GMP-certified facilities that also meet Health Canada requirements. We handle all regulatory compliance including proper labeling, structure-function claims review for the US market, and NPN applications for Canada. Our quality team ensures every batch meets or exceeds both FDA and Health Canada requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of supplements can you manufacture?",
    answer: "We manufacture all major supplement formats including capsules (veggie and gelatin), tablets (standard and chewable), softgels, gummies, powders (bulk and stick packs), and liquids. We have 200+ stock formulas across categories like sports nutrition, weight management, immune support, beauty, and general wellness. Custom formulations are available for any supplement type."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does private label manufacturing cost?",
    answer: "White label supplements typically cost $8-12 per unit at our 1000 unit minimum, totaling $8,000-12,000 to start. Private label custom formulas cost $12-18 per unit at minimum quantity, plus $5,000-10,000 for initial R&D and testing. Prices decrease significantly with higher volumes - up to 35% savings at 10,000+ units. All quotes include manufacturing, basic packaging, and quality testing."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the NPN application process take?",
    answer: "For Class I products (lower risk vitamins and minerals), NPN applications typically take 60-90 days. Class II and III products may take 3-12 months depending on complexity. Many of our white label formulas already have NPNs or use pre-cleared ingredients that qualify for faster approval through monograph compliance. We have a 92% first-time approval rate."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer fulfillment and dropshipping services?",
    answer: "Yes, we offer complete fulfillment services including inventory storage, pick-and-pack, and direct-to-consumer shipping for both US and Canadian markets. Our dropshipping program allows you to sell without holding inventory - we ship directly to your customers with your branding. This is perfect for e-commerce businesses wanting to test products or scale without warehouse costs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get samples before placing a full order?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide samples of our stock formulas so you can evaluate quality before committing. For white label products, sample sets are available for a small fee that's credited toward your final order. For private label custom formulations, we'll create small test batches during R&D for your approval. This ensures you're 100% satisfied with the product before full production."
