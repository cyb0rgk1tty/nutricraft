  {
    question: "Which platform is best for my supplement brand?",
    answer: "For 90% of supplement brands, Shopify is the best choice. It's easy to use, has built-in e-commerce features, reliable hosting, and a large app ecosystem for marketing and growth. We only recommend custom development or WooCommerce if you have very specific requirements that Shopify can't meet."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a supplement e-commerce website cost?",
    answer: "Website costs vary based on complexity. A basic Shopify store starts at $3,000, a growth-focused site with advanced features runs $7,000+, and fully custom enterprise websites start at $15,000. This includes design, development, and post-launch support. Monthly costs include hosting ($29-$299/month for Shopify) and any premium apps or plugins."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a supplement website?",
    answer: "A standard Shopify store takes 3-4 weeks from kickoff to launch. More complex sites with custom features take 4-6 weeks. Fully custom development projects typically require 6-8 weeks. Timeline depends on client feedback speed, content readiness, and complexity of requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide content writing for product pages?",
    answer: "We can help optimize product descriptions and write basic copy, but we recommend clients provide initial product information since they know their products best. For comprehensive content writing (blog posts, detailed product descriptions, SEO content), we can connect you with professional copywriters specializing in supplements."
  },
  {
    question: "Will my website be mobile-friendly?",
    answer: "Absolutely. All our websites are mobile-first and fully responsive, meaning they work perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops. Since over 60% of e-commerce traffic comes from mobile devices, we prioritize mobile experience in every design."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with FDA compliance and disclaimers?",
    answer: "Yes, we include FDA-compliant disclaimer language on your website and ensure proper display of supplement facts panels. However, we recommend consulting with a regulatory compliance expert or attorney for specific health claims and marketing language. We can connect you with specialists in supplement compliance."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you integrate with Amazon, social media, or other sales channels?",
    answer: "Yes, we can integrate your website with Amazon, Facebook Shop, Instagram Shopping, TikTok Shop, and other sales channels. This allows you to manage inventory and orders from a central location while selling across multiple platforms."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in post-launch support?",
    answer: "Post-launch support includes bug fixes, technical troubleshooting, training on how to manage your website, and answering questions. Our Starter package includes 1 month, Growth includes 3 months, and Premium includes 6 months. After that, we offer ongoing maintenance packages for continued support."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with SEO and getting my site ranked on Google?",
    answer: "Yes, all our websites include basic SEO setup: optimized page titles, meta descriptions, clean URLs, fast load speeds, and mobile responsiveness. For more aggressive SEO campaigns (link building, content marketing, ongoing optimization), we recommend working with an SEO specialist or agency. We can connect you with trusted partners."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I already have a website and just need improvements?",
    answer: "We offer website redesign and optimization services. This includes UX audits, design refreshes, speed optimization, mobile improvements, and conversion rate optimization. Pricing depends on the scope of work, but typically starts at $2,000 for optimization projects and $5,000+ for full redesigns."
