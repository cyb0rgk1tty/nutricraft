Creatine just posted 77% dollar sales growth over 52 weeks, according to SPINS data through November 2025. The global market hit $1.11 billion in 2024. And the people buying it look nothing like the gym bros who made it famous in the '90s.

Knowledge workers are taking it for focus. Women going through perimenopause are using it for brain fog. Researchers are testing it on Alzheimer's patients. Podcasters like Andrew Huberman, Peter Attia, and Rhonda Patrick have spent hours explaining its brain benefits to millions of listeners.

Creatine's average monthly popularity across search and social platforms reached 48.8 million, up 78.6% year-over-year according to NIQ and Spate. That's not a niche ingredient trend. That's a cultural shift.

For supplement brand owners, the question isn't whether creatine belongs in your product line. It's how fast you can get a differentiated product to market before the window narrows. And there are real pitfalls here, especially if you're considering gummies.

Let me walk through the science, the opportunities, and the manufacturing realities.

## How creatine powers your brain (not just your muscles)

Most people still associate creatine with muscle. That's understandable. Decades of research have established creatine monohydrate as one of the most effective sports performance supplements ever studied. But the brain story is where things get interesting for brand positioning.

Your brain is 2% of your body weight but burns through 20% of your body's total energy. It's the most metabolically demanding organ you have, and it runs on the same ATP energy system that creatine supports in muscle tissue. The phosphocreatine system shuttles high-energy phosphate groups to regenerate ATP, and this process is just as critical in neurons as it is in muscle fibers.

Xu and colleagues published a meta-analysis in Frontiers in Nutrition in 2024 that pulled together 16 randomized controlled trials covering 492 participants. The results showed significant improvements in memory, attention, and processing speed with creatine supplementation. The standardized mean difference was 0.31 for memory tasks, which is modest but statistically meaningful across multiple study designs.

That's the pooled evidence. Individual studies are even more striking.

A pilot trial from the CABA (Creatine to Augment Brain function in Alzheimer's disease) initiative, led by Taylor and colleagues with Smith as first author (published 2025), found that creatine supplementation increased brain creatine levels by 11% over just eight weeks in Alzheimer's patients. Participants also showed improved working memory. This is early-stage research, but it's the kind of data that gets neuroscience labs funded for larger trials.

Then there's the sleep deprivation work. Gordji-Nejad and colleagues published a study in Scientific Reports in 2024 showing that a single dose of creatine restored cognitive performance during 21 hours of sleep deprivation. Think about who cares about that: shift workers, new parents, military personnel, anyone pulling long hours in demanding cognitive roles. The military angle is particularly interesting because the Department of Defense already includes creatine on its list of supplements with sufficient evidence for specific benefits.

The Alzheimer's research is still early, but the trajectory is worth watching. If the CABA trial results hold up in larger studies, creatine could become a standard recommendation for cognitive maintenance in aging populations. That's not a fringe claim. It's the direction the data is pointing.

The concept emerging from this body of work is sometimes called the "muscle-brain axis." Creatine isn't just a sports supplement that happens to affect the brain. It's a fundamental cellular energy molecule, and the brain happens to need enormous amounts of cellular energy.

This reframing matters for your product positioning. You're not selling a gym supplement to non-gym people. You're selling brain energy support backed by a molecule with 30+ years of safety data.

## Women's health: the most underserved opportunity in the creatine market

Here's a stat that should stop every brand owner in their tracks: only 36% of creatine consumers are women, according to Lumina Intelligence. Yet women have 70-80% lower endogenous creatine stores than men (Smith-Ryan et al., 2021, published in Nutrients). Women quite literally have more to gain from supplementation, and they're drastically underrepresented in the customer base.

This gap exists because of decades of marketing. Creatine was sold to men, by men, in containers designed for men, with messaging about getting jacked. Women were told creatine would make them bulky and bloated. Neither claim holds up to scrutiny.

### What the research actually shows for women

Smith-Ryan and colleagues published a comprehensive lifespan review in 2025 covering creatine's effects on women from menstruation through pregnancy to menopause. The takeaway: creatine has potential benefits at every major hormonal transition.

**Perimenopause and menopause** are where the opportunity is most acute. Women going through these transitions commonly report brain fog, poor sleep, declining bone density, muscle loss, and increased inflammation. Creatine has research supporting benefits in each of these areas, and the mechanisms make biological sense: estrogen decline reduces the body's ability to synthesize and utilize creatine, meaning supplementation becomes more important precisely when women need cellular energy support most.

For bone health, creatine combined with resistance training has shown improvements in bone mineral density markers in postmenopausal women. For sleep, the cellular energy support may help compensate for the sleep disruptions that accompany hormonal changes. For muscle preservation, creatine's well-established effects on lean mass are particularly relevant for women losing muscle during the menopausal transition.

The depression data is especially compelling. Lyoo and colleagues published a study in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 2012 that added creatine to SSRI treatment in women with major depressive disorder. The creatine group had double the remission rate: 52% versus 26% for SSRIs alone. That's not a subtle effect. And it makes sense mechanistically: depression is associated with impaired brain energy metabolism, and creatine directly supports the brain's primary energy system.

One common objection from women considering creatine: bloating. A study in adolescent females found no significant bloating when researchers controlled for menstrual cycle timing. The perceived bloating in earlier anecdotal reports was likely menstrual water retention being attributed to creatine. This matters for marketing because the bloating myth is the single biggest barrier to adoption among women. Brands that address it head-on with data will earn trust faster.

### The demand is already here

Browse r/Menopause on Reddit for ten minutes and you'll find women actively seeking information about creatine. They're reading the research, asking their doctors, and looking for products that speak to them specifically. Posts with titles like "anyone tried creatine for brain fog?" regularly get hundreds of upvotes and dozens of replies from women sharing their experiences. The demand side is solved. What's missing is the supply side: products formulated and marketed for women's health contexts rather than muscle gain.

As one researcher put it, "Women want to know the benefits, yet most brands just put a female on the label." A pink tub of the same 5g creatine monohydrate powder doesn't count as a women's health product. Real differentiation means formulating around women's specific needs: combining creatine with ingredients that address the full perimenopause symptom profile, using packaging and messaging that reflects health rather than performance, and providing education about why women's lower baseline stores make supplementation particularly valuable.

## Who's actually buying creatine now

The consumer base has fundamentally shifted. Here's the rough timeline:

**1990s-2000s:** Creatine was a bodybuilding and sports supplement. GNC was the primary channel. The consumer was overwhelmingly young, male, and focused on muscle mass.

**2010s:** The "evidence-based fitness" crowd (think Examine.com readers) pushed creatine as the most well-researched supplement in existence. The consumer broadened to include recreational exercisers and health-conscious men.

**2020-present:** Health podcasters broke creatine out of the fitness category entirely. Huberman Lab episodes on brain health, Peter Attia's discussions of longevity, and Rhonda Patrick's deep dives into cellular energy put creatine in front of audiences who'd never set foot in a supplement store. TikTok and Instagram amplified the message further. Creatine went from something you bought at GNC to something your therapist or naturopath might recommend.

The influencer-to-consumer pipeline here is worth understanding. A Huberman episode reaches 3-4 million listeners. A fraction of those search for the supplement discussed. They find Amazon listings and brand websites. The brands that show up with targeted messaging for the specific benefit discussed (brain health, sleep, women's wellness) capture those customers. The brands still selling "CREATINE: GET HUGE" on a black container with lightning bolts do not.

The result is a consumer base that now includes:

- **Knowledge workers** who want cognitive edge and mental clarity
- **Women 35-55** concerned about perimenopause symptoms, bone health, and brain fog
- **Aging adults** focused on sarcopenia prevention and cognitive decline
- **Vegans and vegetarians** who get zero dietary creatine (meat is the primary food source)
- **Parents** interested in safe, well-researched supplements with decades of safety data
- **Biohackers** stacking creatine with nootropics for cognitive optimization protocols

Each of these segments wants different products, different messaging, and different formats. A single SKU of unflavored creatine monohydrate powder doesn't serve this market anymore.

The vegan demographic deserves special attention here. Creatine is synthesized in the body from amino acids, but the majority of daily creatine needs in omnivores come from dietary meat and fish. Vegans and vegetarians have measurably lower muscle and brain creatine stores, which means the baseline for improvement is larger. Several studies have shown that vegetarians experience more pronounced cognitive and physical benefits from creatine supplementation than meat-eaters. If you're building a vegan supplement line, creatine should be near the top of your ingredient list.

## The gummy quality crisis (and why it matters for your brand)

If you're thinking about launching creatine gummies, read this section carefully.

Creatine gummy searches increased over 1,300% according to the Vitamin Shoppe's 2025 Trend Report. Consumers want them. The format is familiar, convenient, and perceived as more pleasant than mixing powder. But there's a serious problem: most creatine gummies don't actually contain meaningful amounts of creatine.

### The testing data

James Smith, working with Eurofins (one of the world's largest testing laboratories), tested nine creatine gummy brands available to consumers. Five of the nine contained less than 2% of the creatine amount listed on the label. Not 20%. Not 50%. Less than 2%. Functionally zero.

NOW, the supplement company that also operates a major testing laboratory, conducted separate testing with similar results. About 50% of the gummy brands they tested failed to deliver their label claim for creatine content.

This isn't a manufacturing oversight. It's a chemistry problem.

### Why gummies fail

Crystal Webber, a formulation scientist who's spoken extensively about this issue (NutraIngredients covered her analysis in July 2025), explained the degradation pathway: when creatine sits in an acidic, heated, liquid environment (which describes a gummy matrix during and after manufacturing), it converts to creatinine. Creatinine is biologically useless for the purposes consumers are buying the product.

The heat of the gummy manufacturing process starts the degradation. The acidic pH of most gummy formulations accelerates it. And the moisture content keeps the reaction going throughout shelf life. By the time the consumer opens the bottle, much of the creatine has already converted.

As Webber put it: "The safest path is not the cheapest path."

### Solutions that actually work

If you're committed to the gummy format, there are options, but they cost more:

- **XtraGummies and similar platforms** use specialized encapsulation to protect creatine from the gummy matrix
- **OptiCreatine** is a stabilized creatine form designed specifically for challenging delivery formats
- **Polymer coatings** can create a barrier between the creatine and the acidic gummy environment
- **Accelerated stability testing** is non-negotiable; you need to verify your creatine content at manufacture, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months

We tell brand owners the same thing: if you're going to do creatine gummies, budget for stability testing and premium excipients. Cutting corners here doesn't mean a slightly worse product. It means a product that doesn't work at all. And when investigative testing catches up (and it will), brands selling empty gummies will face serious reputation damage.

The quality-focused manufacturers will win this shakeout. Brands that can actually deliver 3-5g of creatine in a gummy format and prove it through third-party testing have a real competitive advantage.

## Product opportunities for brand owners

Here's where things get practical. The creatine market is fragmenting into specific use cases, and there's room for targeted products that go beyond the generic "creatine monohydrate 5g" tub.

| Product concept | Key ingredients | Target consumer | Format options |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cognitive performance stack | Creatine (5g) + citicoline (500mg) + phosphatidylserine (100mg) | Knowledge workers, students, professionals | Powder, capsules, stick packs |
| Women's wellness formula | Creatine (5g) + collagen (10g) + iron bisglycinate + B-complex | Women 25-45, fitness-minded | Powder (flavored), capsules |
| Active aging blend | Creatine (5-8g) + vitamin D3 (2000 IU) + protein (20g) | Adults 55+, sarcopenia prevention | Powder (meal replacement style) |
| Perimenopause support | Creatine (5g) + ashwagandha + magnesium glycinate + L-theanine | Women 40-55 experiencing symptoms | Capsules, powder |
| Vegan-optimized creatine | Creatine (5g) + B12 + iron + carnosine | Vegans and vegetarians | Capsules, powder |

A few notes on these concepts:

**Vegans are an especially strong market.** Since creatine is found almost exclusively in meat and fish, vegans and vegetarians have significantly lower baseline creatine stores. The value proposition is stronger for this group than for omnivores. Pair creatine with other nutrients vegans commonly lack (B12, iron, carnosine) and you have a compelling product story.

**Stick packs are underutilized.** Single-serve stick packs solve the "gym bag" problem and the "travel" problem simultaneously. They also enable a premium price point. The format works especially well for cognitive positioning because it fits into a desk or laptop bag.

**Capsules face a dosing challenge.** At 5g per serving, you're looking at 8-10 capsules if you're using standard capsule sizes. That's fine for committed users, but it limits the casual consumer market. Powder remains the most practical format for full therapeutic doses. (For a deeper look at how format affects absorption and compliance, see our guide on [why supplement form matters more than the ingredient](/blog/why-supplement-form-matters).)

**Gummies require the caveats above.** If you're doing gummies, you're spending more per unit on stability and specialized ingredients. Build that into your pricing. Most brands that fail in this format are trying to hit a low price point with standard gummy manufacturing, and they end up selling creatinine.

## Dosing: the industry is moving beyond 5 grams

Five grams per day has been the standard creatine dose for decades, and for good reason. It's well-established for muscle saturation, extensively studied, and considered safe by virtually every regulatory and research body that has reviewed it.

But the emerging research on brain health and whole-body benefits suggests higher doses may be warranted for specific populations and goals.

Here's what the literature is pointing toward:

**General muscle health and maintenance:** 3-5g/day remains the standard. This is the dose supported by hundreds of studies and decades of real-world use. For most healthy adults doing regular exercise, this is sufficient.

**Cognitive benefits:** The meta-analysis data includes studies using 5-20g/day, with higher doses showing stronger effects in some cognitive domains. The sleep deprivation study by Gordji-Nejad used a loading protocol. For brain-focused products, 5g is likely the minimum effective dose, and some researchers are exploring 8-10g for more pronounced cognitive effects.

**Bone health:** Research on creatine and bone density has typically used 8g/day or higher. Below that threshold, effects on bone markers are inconsistent.

**Full-body optimization:** Some clinicians and researchers are proposing 8-10g/day as the dose needed to fully saturate not just muscle tissue but also brain, bone, and other tissues. This is still an evolving area, but it's worth watching.

**What this means for your formulation:** Consider offering tiered dosing options. A "standard" 5g scoop plus a "performance" 10g scoop in the same container, for example. Or separate products at different dose levels for different use cases. This also affects your cost modeling since creatine monohydrate is cheap per gram, but doubling the dose still affects packaging, shipping weight, and servings per container.

Loading protocols (20g/day for 5-7 days) are still used in research settings but aren't necessary for most consumers. Steady daily dosing reaches the same saturation levels within 3-4 weeks. That said, some consumers prefer the loading approach because they feel effects sooner. If you're formulating a product that includes loading instructions, make sure the serving size math works out cleanly. Nobody wants to scoop four times from a tub that has messy serving calculations.

One more formulation consideration: timing doesn't matter much. Unlike caffeine or melatonin, creatine works through saturation, not acute dosing. Morning, evening, with food, without food, before training, after training. The research shows no significant difference. Take it consistently, and the timing takes care of itself. This is actually a selling point for consumer education because it removes a common barrier to compliance.

## What this means for your supplement brand

The numbers are hard to ignore. Grand View Research projects the global creatine market to reach $2.86 billion by 2030. Some estimates with broader supplement categorization put it closer to $4.2 billion. The U.S. market alone is growing at a 29% CAGR.

That growth rate doesn't last forever, but it tells you the current phase of market development: demand is outrunning supply of differentiated products. There are hundreds of generic creatine monohydrate tubs on Amazon. There are very few products built specifically for women's perimenopause support, cognitive performance, or active aging.

But here's what those aggregate numbers miss: the growth isn't evenly distributed. Generic creatine monohydrate powder is a race to the bottom on Amazon, where brands compete on price and Prime shipping speed. The growth is happening in specialized, demographic-targeted products where consumers are willing to pay premium prices for formulations that speak to their specific needs.

We're seeing this firsthand in our manufacturing inquiries. Two years ago, creatine orders were almost exclusively for sports nutrition brands. Now roughly 40% of our creatine-related conversations are about cognitive health, women's wellness, or healthy aging positioning. The brands asking these questions tend to be more sophisticated about formulation and more willing to invest in quality testing.

### How to differentiate

**Lead with the use case, not the ingredient.** Don't sell "creatine." Sell "brain fuel for demanding days" or "perimenopause muscle and mind support" or "vegan energy optimization." The ingredient is the same, but the framing, formulation partners, dosing, and packaging should reflect the specific consumer.

**Invest in quality proof.** Given the gummy testing scandals and broader supplement industry trust issues (see our guide on [how to tell if supplements are fake](/blog/how-to-tell-if-supplements-are-fake)), brands that publish certificates of analysis, use third-party testing, and can demonstrate label accuracy have a real edge. This is table stakes for creatine gummies but smart positioning for any format.

**Consider combination products.** Standalone creatine is a commodity play with brutal margin pressure. Combination products (creatine + complementary ingredients for a specific use case) command higher margins and create genuine differentiation. The product concepts table above gives you starting points.

**Move fast on underserved demographics.** The women's health creatine space is wide open. So is vegan-targeted creatine. So is cognitive health positioning for professionals. The first brands to establish themselves in these niches will have significant advantages as the market matures.

**Choose the right manufacturing partner.** Speed to market matters in a fast-growing category. Working with a [contract manufacturer](/services/private-white-label-manufacturing) that already has creatine formulation experience, stability testing capabilities, and multiple format options (powder, capsules, stick packs) lets you launch in weeks rather than months. We offer 100+ stock formulas with creatine-based options ready for white-label customization, starting at just 1,000 units.

## Frequently asked questions

### Does creatine cause hair loss?

This concern traces back to a single 2009 study in rugby players that found elevated DHT (dihydrotestosterone) levels with creatine loading. DHT is linked to male pattern baldness. But that study has never been replicated, and multiple subsequent reviews have found no consistent evidence connecting creatine to hair loss. The International Society of Sports Nutrition's 2017 position stand did not list hair loss as a concern. If your customers ask, the honest answer is: one small study raised the question, and the follow-up research hasn't confirmed it.

### Is creatine safe for women?

Yes. Creatine has been studied in women across multiple age groups and life stages, including during pregnancy (though dosing recommendations during pregnancy should come from a healthcare provider). The Smith-Ryan 2025 lifespan review specifically examined female-focused research and found no unique safety concerns. Side effects are similar to men: potential mild water retention during the first few weeks, which typically resolves. The bloating concern is largely a myth when controlling for menstrual cycle timing.

### What's the best form of creatine?

Creatine monohydrate. This isn't even close. It's the most researched, most bioavailable, most cost-effective form. Other forms (creatine HCl, creatine ethyl ester, buffered creatine, creatine magnesium chelate) have been marketed as superior, but none have demonstrated meaningful advantages over monohydrate in head-to-head studies. Some, like creatine ethyl ester, actually perform worse. For formulators, monohydrate is the clear choice unless you're working with a format (like gummies) where stability requires a specialized form.

### Do creatine gummies actually work?

Some do. Most don't. The testing data from Eurofins and NOW shows that the majority of creatine gummies on the market contain negligible amounts of actual creatine. The degradation problem (creatine converting to creatinine in acidic, moist, heated environments) is real and well-documented. If you're buying creatine gummies, look for brands that publish third-party stability testing, not just initial certificate of analysis testing. If you're manufacturing them, invest in stabilized creatine forms and conduct accelerated stability studies. Don't assume your gummies contain what you think they contain at 6 or 12 months.

### How much creatine should I take for brain health?

The research varies, but 5g/day is a reasonable starting point based on the available meta-analysis data (Xu et al., 2024). Some cognitive studies have used higher doses (10-20g/day), and there's a rationale for doses above 5g if brain health is the primary goal, since the brain may require higher circulating creatine levels for full tissue saturation. Start with 5g, and discuss higher doses with a healthcare provider. No loading phase is necessary; consistent daily intake reaches saturation within a few weeks.

### Is creatine just for young people?

The opposite might be true. Older adults stand to benefit more because they have naturally declining creatine stores, reduced muscle mass (sarcopenia), and increased cognitive vulnerability. The active aging population (55+) is actually one of the most promising demographics for creatine products. Research on creatine and aging covers muscle preservation, bone health, cognitive function, and even depression. If anything, older adults have more reasons to supplement than younger ones.

## The bottom line for brand owners

Creatine's transformation from gym supplement to mainstream health ingredient isn't speculation. It's happening in the sales data, the research labs, and the consumer conversations right now. The 77% sales growth reflects genuine demand across demographics that the supplement industry has barely started serving.

The brands that will capture this market are ones that go beyond slapping "creatine" on a label. They'll formulate for specific use cases, invest in quality verification (especially for challenging formats like gummies), and speak directly to the consumers who are already searching for these products.
